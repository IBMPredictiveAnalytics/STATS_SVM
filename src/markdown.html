<p>This command operates in two modes.  If <strong>CMDMODE</strong>=ESTIMATE, the model is built,
and, optionally, the fitted values for the dependent variable are saved to a new
dataset.  If <strong>CMDMODE</strong>=PREDICT, a previously estimated model is loaded from a file
or is taken from the current workspace, and a new dataset with predicted values
is generated.  All estimation parameters are supplied only in estimate mode.  </p>

<p>In predict mode, no model parameters are specified, but the model source 
is required.  Any estimation parameters specified are ignored, but the ID
variable can be different from the estimation ID.
The model independent variables are read from the Statistics active dataset.</p>

<p>For CMDMODE=ESTIMATE, all the cases are considered the training dataset.  Select
holdout cases before calling the procedure, and use predict mode to
assess performance.</p>

<p>If the dependent variable is categorical, the SVM is a classification model;
otherwise it is a regression model, except that if there is no dependent
variable, it can be used for detecting anomalies.  For classification
models with more than two classes, a model is estimated for each pair
of values and predictions are made by voting.</p>

<p>Categorical predictors 
are automatically converted to factors.  The SVM types are for classification
or regression as their names indicate, defaulting to CCLASSIFICATION or 
EPSREGRESSION.  If no dependent variable is specified, ONECLASSIFICATION 
is assumed.</p>

<p>For prediction, the source of the already estimated model is
specified in the <strong>WORKSPACEFILE</strong> parameter of the first part of the 
command.  It can be a quoted file specification or * to indicate that
the model is in the current workspace as might be the case if the
model was just estimated, and the workspace was retained.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p>There are four kernel types with various parameters.  They are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>LINEAR</strong>:     u&#39; &#42; v</li>
<li><strong>POLYNOMIAL</strong>: (GAMMA &#42; u&#39; &#42; v + COEF0)<sup>&#42;DEGREE</sup></li>
<li><strong>RADIAL</strong>:     exp(-GAMMA &#42; |u-v|<sup>&#42;2</sup> )</li>
<li><strong>SIGMOID</strong>:     tanh(GAMMA * u&#39; * v + COEF0)</li>
</ul>

<p>where u and v are independent variable cases.</p>

<p>The defaults are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DEGREE</strong> = 3 </li>
<li><strong>GAMMA</strong> = 1/(number of independent variables) </li>
<li><strong>COEF0</strong> = 0 </li>
<li><strong>COST</strong> = 1 </li>
<li><strong>EPSILON</strong> = .1</li>
<li><strong>NU</strong> = .5</li>
</ul>

<p>NU is used in the NU- or ONE- SVM types.  0 &lt;= nu &lt; 1.</p>

<p>The kernel parameters as well as NU and EPSILON can be specified 
as single values or as lists of values.  If any parameter has 
more than one value, a grid search is carried out to find the 
best values for the model.  The specified or selected values 
are displayed in an output table.</p>

<p><strong>SCALE</strong> indicates whether the data should be scaled or not.  If YES,
a table of the scaling factors is displayed.  When predicting,
the scaling transform from the estimation data is applied to the new
input data.</p>

<p><strong>CLASSWEIGHTS</strong> can specify nonuniform weights for the factor levels.
of a classification model.  It is written as pairs of factor 
values and weights.  For example,
<code>&#39;clerical&#39; .5 &#39;custodial&#39; 1 &#39;manager&#39; 2.</code><br/>
The levels should be string or numeric corresponding to the 
type of the dependent variable.  Omitted classes get a weight of 1.</p>

<p><strong>MISSING</strong>=OMIT causes cases with any missing values to be omitted.
<strong>MISSING</strong>=FAIL causes the procedure to stop if there are any missing values.</p>

<p><strong>NUMCROSSFOLDS</strong> specifies k-fold cross validation.  If k &gt; 0, a table
of accuracies is displayed.</p>

<h2>SAVE</h2>

<p>For both estimate and predict modes, the predicted values can be
written to a new dataset specified by <strong>DATASET</strong>.  The dataset name
must not already be in use.  If an ID variable was specified,
it is included in the dataset.  Since missing value deletion
may cause some cases not to appear in the dataset, an ID may
be necessary in to match the dataset back to the input.</p>

<p>If PROBPRED is YES at estimation time and it is a classification
model, when a dataset is created in predict mode, the probability
for each class is included in the output dataset.</p>

<p><strong>WORKSPACEFILE</strong>, which applies only
in estimate mode, specifies that the model be written to the 
specified file.  </p>

<p><strong>DECISIONVALUES</strong> specifies whether or not to include these in the 
prediction dataset.  They are not provided if the dependent 
variable has only two values.  If a categorical
dependent variable has k values, there will be <code>k(k-1)/2</code>
additional variables in the dataset.</p>

<p>If <strong>WORKSPACE</strong> = CLEAR, the model is deleted
from memory while RETAIN causes it to be available for use
in predict mode in the current session unless the workspace
has been otherwise cleared.  Multiple uses of predict
mode can use the retained workspace as long as
WORKSPACE=RETAIN is used each time.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>

<p><strong>FEATUREWEIGHTS</strong> specifies whether or not to display a table
of variable weights for the model.</p>
